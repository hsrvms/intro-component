## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned alot about form validations with pure React.js in this challange.  

Example: 
```
<input onBlur={handleBlur} />

```

### Useful resources

- [Lama Dev Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIdNeoHniEY) - This taught me form validations, error messages and more. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
